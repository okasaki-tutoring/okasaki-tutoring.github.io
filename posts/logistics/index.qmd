### Getting Started

When you contact me I will first work with you to determine briefly what courses and topics you would like to cover in our sessions and verify that they are topics I am qualified to teach. I will then book an initial appointment for you. Appointments may be over zoom, in-person in my home, in-person in your home, or elsewhere.

### Booking Your First Appointment 

First we will determine the time, location, and price of your appointment. This coordination can be done over email, phone, or text depending on your personal preference. Once you have booked your initial appointment, I will ask that you send me the following information. Different professors can have very different takes on the same subject. In order for me to provide the best possible service for you, I will review these materials before your appointment.

- a course syllabus
- the name of any textbooks you are using
- the topic you would like to discuss
- (optional) the homework assignment you would like to discuss
- (optional) any specific questions you have at the moment
- (optional) any relevant notes or slides from your professor

If you would prefer, I am happy to schedule a complimentary 15 minute call over Zoom or phone to discuss what you would like to cover during our sessions.

### Pricing

As a highly qualified and specialized tutor, with a PhD and experience teaching college-level classes, I will ultimately be charging a base rate of $100-$150/hour. However, at this early stage of my business, I am charging a base rate of $50/hour in exchange for testimonials and reviews. A very limited number of sliding scale appointments are available on a case-by-case basis for those who cannot afford this rate.

If you wish to meet in-person outside of my home, I will charge for any travel time beyond 30 minutes round trip, at the same rate as our appointment. 

### Policies

If you arrive late to our appointment, the appointment will still end on time and I will charge you for the full time length of our appointment. If you arrive more than 15 minutes late I reserve the right to cancel your appointment, although in this case I will only charge you for my actual time (15 minutes + travel time). Appointments cancelled less than 24 hours in advance will incur a cancellation fee equal to the 15 minute late fee. 

Payment is due immediately following our appointment, at the negotiated price. In the event of non-payment, no further appointments will be scheduled until payment is received.
