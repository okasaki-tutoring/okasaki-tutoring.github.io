    "text": "I am available to tutor math, science, and standardized tests. More detailed information on my subject expertise can be found in this post.\nA little about me. My background is in math, statistics, physics, and ecology. I am a PhD candidate in Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management and an MS student in Statistics at the University of Washington. I have instructed numerous math and statistics course in recent years, both in person and online. Throughout these teaching experiences, what I consistently found most rewarding was the one-on-one or small group tutoring that I did during office hours. Coming out of those experiences, I have decided to start a small tutoring business with which I can continue just those sorts of rewarding teaching moments.\nI am currently available only for limited hours while I complete and defend my dissertation."

    "text": "Booking Your First Appointment\nFirst we will determine the time, location, and price of your appointment. This coordination can be done over email, phone, or text depending on your personal preference. Once you have booked your initial appointment, I will ask that you send me the following information. Different professors can have very different takes on the same subject. In order for me to provide the best possible service for you, I will review these materials before your appointment.\n\na course syllabus\nthe name of any textbooks you are using\nthe topic you would like to discuss\n(optional) the homework assignment you would like to discuss\n(optional) any specific questions you have at the moment\n(optional) any relevant notes or slides from your professor\n\nIf you would prefer, I am happy to schedule a complimentary 15 minute call over Zoom or phone to discuss what you would like to cover during our sessions.\n\n\nPricing\nAs a highly qualified and specialized tutor, with a PhD and experience teaching college-level classes, I will ultimately be charging a base rate of $100-$150/hour. However, at this early stage of my business, I am charging a base rate of $50/hour in exchange for testimonials and reviews. A very limited number of sliding scale appointments are available on a case-by-case basis for those who cannot afford this rate.\nIf you wish to meet in-person outside of my home, I will charge for any travel time beyond 30 minutes round trip, at the same rate as our appointment.\n\n\nPolicies\nIf you arrive late to our appointment, the appointment will still end on time and I will charge you for the full time length of our appointment. If you arrive more than 15 minutes late I reserve the right to cancel your appointment, although in this case I will only charge you for my actual time (15 minutes + travel time). Appointments cancelled less than 24 hours in advance will incur a cancellation fee equal to the 15 minute late fee.\nPayment is due immediately following our appointment, at the negotiated price. In the event of non-payment, no further appointments will be scheduled until payment is received."
