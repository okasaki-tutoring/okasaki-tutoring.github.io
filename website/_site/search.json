    "text": "I am available to tutor math, science, and standardized tests. More detailed information on my subject expertise can be found in this post.\nA little about me. My background is in math, statistics, physics, and ecology. I am a PhD candidate in Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management and an MS student in Statistics at the University of Washington. I have instructed numerous math and statistics course in recent years, both in person and online. Throughout these teaching experiences, what I consistently found most rewarding was the one-on-one or small group tutoring that I did during office hours. Coming out of those experiences, I have decided to start a small tutoring business with which I can continue just those sorts of rewarding teaching moments.\nI am currently available only for limited hours while I complete and defend my dissertation."
